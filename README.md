# ADAMANT Blockchain Explorer

ADAMANT Explorer version 1.3.0 works in conjunction with the Secu Core API. It uses Redis for caching data and Freegeoip to parse IP geo-location data.

## Prerequisites

These programs and resources are required to install and run Lisk Explorer

- Nodejs v6.10.1 or higher (<https://nodejs.org/>) -- Nodejs serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

  ```
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  ```

- Redis (<http://redis.io>) -- Redis is used for caching parsed exchange data.

  `sudo apt-get install -y redis-server`

- Freegeoip (<https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip>) -- Freegeoip is used by the Network Monitor for IP address geo-location.

  ```
  wget https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip/releases/download/v3.1.5/freegeoip-3.1.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  tar -zxf freegeoip-3.1.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ln -s freegeoip-3.1.5-linux-amd64 freegeoip
  nohup ./freegeoip/freegeoip > ./freegeoip/freegeoip.log 2>&1 &
  ```

- Grunt.js (<http://gruntjs.com/>) -- Grunt is used to run eslint and unit tests.

  `sudo npm install -g grunt`

- PM2 (https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) -- PM2 manages the node process for Lisk Explorer and handles log rotation (Highly Recommended)

  `sudo npm install -g pm2`
  
- PM2-logrotate (https://github.com/pm2-hive/pm2-logrotate) -- Manages PM2 logs

  ```
  pm2 install pm2-logrotate
  pm2 set pm2-logrotate:max_size 100M
  ```

- Git (<https://github.com/git/git>) -- Used for cloning and updating Lisk Explorer

  `sudo apt-get install -y git`

- Tool chain components -- Used for compiling dependencies

  `sudo apt-get install -y python build-essential automake autoconf libtool`

## Installation Steps

Clone the ADAMANT Explorer Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/zyuhel/adamant-explorer.git
cd adamant-explorer
npm install
```

## Build Steps

#### Frontend
 The frontend is using Webpack to create core bundles for Adamant Explorer.  
 
 For having a watcher to generate bundles continuously for all the changes of the code, Run the following command:

`npm run start`
 
 And for generating the minified bundles in production environment run:
 
`npm run build`


## Configuration

The default `config.js` file contains all of the configuration settings for Lisk Explorer. These options can be modified according to comments included in configuration file.


## Managing ADAMANT Explorer

To test that ADAMANT Explorer is configured correctly, run the following command:

`node app.js`

Open: <http://localhost:6040>, or if its running on a remote system, switch `localhost` for the external IP Address of the machine.

Once the process is verified as running correctly, `CTRL+C` and start the process with `PM2`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

`pm2 start pm2-explorer.json`

After the process is started its runtime status and log location can be found by issuing this statement:

`pm2 list`

To stop Explorer after it has been started with `PM2`, issue the following command:

`pm2 stop lisk-explorer`

## Tests

Before running any tests, please ensure ADAMANT Explorer and ADAMANT Node are configured to run on the ADAMANT Testnet.

Replace **config.js** with **config.test** file from the **test** directory:

`cp test/config.test ./config.js`

Replace the **config.json** for the ADAMANT Node the corresponding file under the **test** directory:

`cp test/config_lisk.json  /PATH_TO_ADAMANT_DIR/config.json`

Then restart the ADAMANT Node (example):

`pm2 restart /PATH_TO_ADAMANT_DIR/app.js`

Launch ADAMANT Explorer (runs on port 6040):

`pm2 start pm2-explorer.json`

Run the test suite:

`npm test`

Run individual tests:

```
npm test -- test/api/accounts.js
npm test -- test/api/transactions.js
```

## End-to-end Tests

### Setup for end-to-end tests:

Do all setup steps from "Test" section of this README

Make sure you have `wget` installed (it's used in `./e2e-test-setup.sh`). On Linux by default. On MacOS:
```
brew install wget
```

Setup protractor

```
./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update
```

### Run end-to-end test suite:

```
./e2e-test-setup.sh /PATH_TO_LISK_DIR
npm run e2e-test -s
```

### Run one end-to-end test feature file:

```
npm run e2e-test -s -- --specs=features/address.feature
```
